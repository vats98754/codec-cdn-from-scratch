# TCF Implementation Status

## Current State

The Text Codec Format (TCF) implementation is partially complete with working components but some synchronization issues between encoder and decoder.

### Working Components

1. **Range Coder**: Arithmetic coding implementation with proper overflow handling
2. **File Format**: TCF header structure with magic bytes, version, and chunk organization
3. **CLI Interface**: Working command-line tools for encode/decode operations
4. **Unicode Support**: NFC normalization for consistent text handling

### Known Issues

1. **Decoder Synchronization**: The decoder currently produces garbled output due to synchronization issues with the encoder
2. **Frequency Model**: The static frequency model needs refinement for better compression
3. **Length Encoding**: Current length encoding method is overly simplified

### Next Steps

1. Fix the range coder synchronization between encoder and decoder
2. Implement proper alphabet encoding in the bitstream
3. Add adaptive frequency modeling for better compression ratios
4. Implement conformance tests with known good vectors
5. Add fuzzing support for robustness testing

### Architecture Notes

The current implementation uses:
- Static frequency models for simplicity
- Basic alphabet handling (ASCII printable characters)
- Simple length encoding (4 bytes, little-endian)
- Range coding with 32-bit precision

For production use, this would need:
- Adaptive modeling (PPM/CM)
- Dictionary support for repetitive text
- Better EOF handling
- Robust error recovery
